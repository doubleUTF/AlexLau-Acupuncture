Goal of this project:

To make a fully functional web app for my acupuncture clinic. The homepage will
be designed with an Eastern-Asian theme with bright and green colors.
Users will be able to register an account with the following features:
  - Manage appointments
  - View visit history and retrieve receipts
  - Pay online
  - Chat with a representative
  - Order herbs
  - Submit insurance and intake forms
  - Enable various languages
  - Allow patients to search for symptoms we treat

  Dependencies:
  Need to install type files for validator module(index.d.ts)

3/23/17
Internal app prototype is ready. Next, work on basic home page and will be ready for alpha.

Update 3/14/17-
  Have to decide whether to let users do a partial or full registration to create account.
  A full registration ensures the back-end will have all the required data
  to create an appointment. However, new users may not be willing to create an account
  just to check insurance. It would be wise to leave the jotform option in the landing
  page to just check insurance for new visitors because not all of them will actually
  come into the clinic for many reasons. For prototype stage, let's leave it at
  partial registration. In later stages, may switch to full registration.

  Considering making only one API call to patients/me or patients/auth so that
  front end gets all the user related data at once. This may be feasible since
  the payload should not be too large(JSON document for a patient max at 1-2MB?
  average user maybe much less.)

  TODOS for 3/16/17-
    -Clean up appointments items CSS, the buttons are misaligned. Graciously
    show no upcoming appointments. *Done
    - Hide the 'chat with us' button for now. -Done
    - Include in email a checkbox allowing us to send certain emails such as
      appointment reminders, changes to account(email, password).
    - Create a FormGroup in the consent section.


  The home or registration page should list reasons/benefits of signing up an account.
